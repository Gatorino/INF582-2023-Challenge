# INF582-2023-Challenge

In this repository you can find a data challenge conducted at Ecole Polytechnique/Institut
Polytechnique de Paris for the "INF582: Introduction to Text Mining and NLP" course.
The goal of this project is to study and apply machine learning/artificial intelligence
techniques to predict whether a paragraph is written by a human or generated by
an AI. We are tasked with studying existing standards and methods for analyzing
a text sequence and design a model capable of classifying a given text sequence as
whether it was generated by an AI system of by a human with good accuracy.
